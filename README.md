# Filmoteka

Filmoteka is a two-page website designed to provide users with access to
trending movies, search for movies based on keywords, view movie details,
trailers, and create their own library of watched movies or movies to watch.

## Home Page

The home page features a search form where users can enter keywords to search
for movies. When no search term is entered, a list of trending movies from the
day is displayed in the form of cards. Clicking on a movie card opens a modal
window where users can explore movie information and add the movie to their
watched list or queue for future viewing. Each movie card also includes a "Watch
the trailer" button, which opens a modal window for users to watch the movie
trailer. At the bottom of the page, pagination is available for easy navigation
between movie lists.

## My Library Page

The "My Library" page is a user's personal library, which includes two sections:
"Watched" and "Queue." These sections display movies as cards based on the
user's previous actions. Clicking on a movie card allows users to view detailed
information about the movie and remove it from their library.
